and around 16 million in the larger metropolitan area of Greater Tehran, Tehran is the most populous city in Iran and Western Asia, and has the second-largest metropolitan area in the Middle East, after Cairo.\n","In the classical antiquity, part of the territory of present-day Tehran was occupied by Rhages , a prominent Median city destroyed in the medieval Arab, Turkic, and Mongol invasions.\n","Modern Ray was absorbed into the metropolitan area of Greater Tehran.\n","Tehran was first chosen as the capital of Iran by Agha Mohammad Khan of the Qajar dynasty in 1786, because of its proximity to Iran's territories in the Caucasus, then separated from Iran in the Russo-Iranian Wars, to avoid the vying factions of the previously ruling Iranian dynasties.\n","The capital has been moved several times throughout history, however, and Tehran became the 32nd capital of Persia.\n","Large-scale construction works began in the 1920s, and Tehran became a destination for mass migrations from all over Iran since the 20th century.\n","Tehran is home to many historical sites, including the royal complexes of Golestan, Sa'dabad, and Niavaran, where the last two dynasties of the former Imperial State of Iran were seated.\n","Tehran's landmarks include the Azadi Tower, a memorial built under the reign of Mohammad Reza Shah of the Pahlavi dynasty in 1971 to mark the 2,500th anniversary of the Persian Empire, the Milad Tower, the world's sixth-tallest self-supporting tower, completed in 2007, and the Tabiat Bridge, completed in 2014.\n","Tehran is served by Imam Khomeini

2016, celebrating the date when in 1907 the city officially became the capital of Iran.\n","Various theories on the origin of the name Tehran have been put forward.\n","Iranian linguist Ahmad Kasravi, in an article \"Shemiran-Tehran\", suggested that Tehran and Kehran mean \"the warm place\", and \"Shemiran\" means \"the cool place\".\n","He listed cities with the same base and suffix and studied the components of the word in ancient Iranian languages, and came to the conclusion that Tehran and Kehran meant the same thing in different Iranian language families, as the constant \"t\" and \"k\" are close to each other in such languages.\n","He also provided evidence that cities named \"Shemiran\" were colder than those named \"Tehran\" or \"Kehran\".\n","Another theory is that \"Tehran\" derives from Tiran/Tirgan, \"the abode of Tir\", the Zoroastrian equivalent of Hermes\n","Mehran still exists as a residential district in Greater Tehran, as well as Ray, which forms the southern suburbs of Tehran.\n","The official City of Tehran website says that \"Tehran\" comes from the Persian words \"Tah\" meaning \"end\", or \"bottom\", and \"Ran\" meaning \" slope\"—literally, the bottom of the mountain .\n","Given Tehran's position at the foot of the Alborz mountains, this seems plausible.\n","The most interesting toponymical theory of the name Tehran has been suggested by Zana Piranshahri , the Iranian linguist residing in Norway.\n","According to Dana Pishdar, the etymological root of the name Tehran should be searched for in the ancient Iranic languages such as Median and Avestan.\n","Because in the pre-islamic era, the city of Rey and the area of Tehran were the largest cities of the Media region, and also in Zoroastrian era, it was considered a holy city and was headquarters of a theocratic government similar to modern Vatican state, this suggestion does not sound illogical.\n","In the opinion of Dana Pishdar, the name of Tehran consists of the two lexical elements, \"Teh\" and \"Ran\".\n","The \"Teh\", meaning \"honeyberry\" was a tree that was used to grow in the northern parts of Tehran province.\n","It is also mentioned in the Dehkhoda dictionary and Dehkhoda explains it in this way: \"Teh\" is a name that in Shemiranat and around Tehran is applied to the \"honeyberry\" tree.\n","So according to Zana Piranshahri, the word Tehran means a place where the \"honeyberry\" tree grows.\n","Also the suffix \"Ran\" is visible in many of the names of districts and villages of modern Tehran that are not unrelated to each other, such as Shemiran, Niavaran, Jamaran, Qasran and Shahran.\n","Therefore, the words \"Rey\" and \"Ran\" are meaning foothills and the toponymic reason for this is the geographical position of Rey and Tehran, because both are located on foothills and in a plain.\n","Archaeological remains from the ancient city of Ray suggest that settlement in Tehran dates back over 6,000 years.\n","Tehran is in the historical Media region of  in northwestern Iran.\n","By the time of the Median Empire, part of present-day Tehran was a suburb of the prominent Median city of Rhages .\n","Mount Damavand, the highest peak of Iran, which is located near Tehran, is an important location in Ferdowsi's Šāhnāme, an Iranian epic poem based on the ancient legends of Iran.\n","In the ninth century, Tehran was a well-known village, but less so than the city of Rhages, flourishing nearby.\n","Others escaped to Tehran.\n","In July 1404, Castilian ambassador Ruy González de Clavijo visited Tehran on a journey to Samarkand, the capital of Turco-Mongol conqueror Timur, the ruler of Iran at the time.\n","Italian traveler Pietro della Valle passed through Tehran overnight in 1618, and in his memoirs called the city Taheran.\n","English traveler Thomas Herbert entered Tehran in 1627, and mentioned it as Tyroan.\n","In the early 18th century, Karim Khan of the Zand dynasty ordered a palace and a government office built in Tehran, possibly to declare the city his capital; but he later moved his government to Shiraz.\n","Eventually, Qajar king Agha Mohammad Khan chose Tehran as the capital of Iran in 1786.\n","Thus, he probably viewed Tehran's lack of a substantial urban structure as a blessing, because it minimized the chances of resistance to his rule by the notables and by the general public.\n","Up until the 1870s, Tehran consisted of a walled citadel, a roofed bazaar, and the three main neighborhoods of Udlajan, Chale-Meydan, and Sangelaj, where the majority resided.\n","The

1,000 kilometers  west of the mainland.\n","The territories of modern-day Ecuador were once home to a variety of Indigenous groups that were gradually incorporated into the Inca Empire during the 15th century.\n","The legacy of both empires is reflected in Ecuador's ethnically diverse population, with most of its 17.8 million people being mestizos, followed by large minorities of Europeans, Native

of future Ecuador before the arrival of the Incas.\n","The first people who reached Ecuador may have journeyed by land from North and Central America or by boat down the Pacific Ocean coastline.\n","Many civilizations arose in Ecuador, such as the Valdivia Culture and Machalilla Culture on the coast, the Quitus , and the Cañari .\n","Similarly, a number of loyal Inca subjects from Peru and Bolivia were brought to Ecuador to prevent rebellion.\n","Thus, the region of highland Ecuador became part of the Inca Empire in 1463 sharing the same language.\n","In contrast, when the Incas made incursions into coastal Ecuador and the eastern Amazon jungles of Ecuador, they found both the environment and indigenous people more hostile.\n","As a result, Inca expansion into the Amazon Basin and the Pacific coast of Ecuador was hampered.\n","The indigenous people of the Amazon jungle and coastal Ecuador remained relatively autonomous until the Spanish soldiers and missionaries arrived in force.\n","The Amazonian people and the Cayapas of Coastal Ecuador were the only groups to resist both Inca and Spanish domination, maintaining their languages and cultures well into the 21st century.\n","The untimely death of both the heir Ninan Cuchi and the Emperor Huayna Capac, from a European disease that spread into Ecuador, created a power vacuum between two

establishing itself as an independent state.\n","Its inhabitants celebrated what is now Ecuador's official Independence Day on 24 May 1822.\n","The rest of Ecuador gained its independence after Antonio José de Sucre defeated the Spanish Royalist forces at the Battle of Pichincha, near Quito.\n","Following the battle, Ecuador joined Simón Bolívar's Republic of Gran Colombia, also including modern-day Colombia, Venezuela, and Panama.\n","In 1830, Ecuador separated from Gran Colombia and became an independent republic.\n","The 19th century was marked by instability for Ecuador with a rapid succession of rulers.\n","The first president of Ecuador was the Venezuelan-born Juan José Flores, who was ultimately deposed.\n","Ecuador abolished slavery in 1851.\n","The descendants of enslaved Ecuadorians are among today's Afro-Ecuadorian population.\n","After Ecuador's separation from Colombia on 13 May 1830, its first President, General Juan José Flores, laid claim to the territory that had belonged to the Real Audiencia of Quito, also referred to as the Presidencia of Quito.\n","In the case of Ecuador, Flores based Ecuador's de jure claims on the Real Cedulas of 1563, 1739, and 1740; with modifications in the Amazon Basin and Andes Mountains that were introduced through the Treaty of Guayaquil  which Peru reluctantly signed, after the overwhelmingly outnumbered Gran Colombian force led by Antonio José de Sucre defeated President and General La Mar's Peruvian invasion force in the Battle of Tarqui.\n","In addition, Ecuador's eastern border with the Portuguese colony of Brazil in the Amazon Basin was modified before the Wars of Independence by the First Treaty of San Ildefonso  between the Spanish Empire and the Portuguese Empire.\n","Moreover, to add legitimacy to his claims, on 16 February 1840, Flores signed a treaty with Spain, whereby Flores convinced Spain to officially recognize Ecuadorian independence and its sole rights to colonial titles over Spain's former colonial territory known anciently to Spain as the Kingdom and Presidency of Quito.\n","Ecuador during its long and turbulent history has lost most of its contested territories to each of its more powerful neighbors, such as Colombia in 1832 and 1916, Brazil in 1904 through a series of peaceful treaties, and Peru after a short war in which the Protocol of Rio de Janeiro was signed in 1942.\n","During the struggle for independence, before Peru or Ecuador became independent nations, a few areas of the former Vice Royalty of New Granada – Guayaquil, Tumbez, and Jaén – declared themselves independent from Spain.\n","A few months later, a part of the Peruvian liberation army of San Martin decided to occupy the independent cities of Tumbez and Jaén with the intention of using these towns as springboards to occupy the independent city of Guayaquil and then to liberate the rest of the Audiencia de Quito .\n","It was common knowledge among the top officers of the liberation army from the south that their leader San Martin wished to liberate present-day Ecuador and add it to the future republic of Peru, since it had been part of the Inca Empire before the Spaniards conquered it.\n","However, Bolívar's intention was to form a new republic known as the Gran Colombia, out of the liberated Spanish territory of New Granada which consisted of Colombia, Venezuela, and Ecuador.\n","This happened a few days before San Martin's Peruvian forces could arrive and occupy Guayaquil, with the intention of annexing Guayaquil to the rest of Audiencia of Quito  and to the future republic of Peru.\n","In the south, Ecuador had de jure claims to a small piece of land beside the Pacific Ocean known as Tumbes which lay between the Zarumilla and Tumbes rivers.\n","In Ecuador's southern Andes Mountain region where the Marañon cuts across, Ecuador had de jure claims to an area it called Jaén de Bracamoros.\n","Some Peruvian generals, without any legal titles backing them up and with Ecuador still federated with the Gran Colombia, had the desire to annex Ecuador to the Republic of Peru at the expense of the Gran Colombia, feeling that Ecuador was once part of the Inca Empire.\n","After Peru was completely liberated from Spain by the patriot armies led by Bolivar and Antonio Jose de Sucre at the Battle of Ayacucho dated 9 December 1824, there was a strong desire by some Peruvians to resurrect the Inca Empire and to include Bolivia and Ecuador.\n","One of these Peruvian Generals was the Ecuadorian-born José de La Mar, who became one of Peru's presidents after Bolivar resigned as dictator of Peru and returned to Colombia.\n","President and General José de La Mar, who was born in Ecuador, believing his opportunity had come to annex the District of Ecuador to Peru, personally, with a Peruvian force, invaded and occupied Guayaquil and a few cities in the Loja region of southern Ecuador on 28 November 1828.\n","According to the peace negotiations Peru agreed to return Guayaquil, Tumbez, and Jaén; despite this, Peru returned Guayaquil, but failed to return Tumbes and Jaén, alleging that it was not obligated to follow the agreements, since the Gran Colombia ceased to exist when it divided itself into three different nations – Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela.\n","After Ecuador's separation, the Department of Cauca voluntarily decided to unite itself with Ecuador due to instability in the central government of Bogota.\n","The Venezuelan born President of Ecuador, the general Juan José Flores, with the approval of the Ecuadorian congress annexed the Department of Cauca on 20 December 1830, since the government of Cauca had called for union with the District of the South as far back as April 1830.\n","Moreover, the Cauca region, throughout its long history, had very strong economic and cultural ties with the people of Ecuador.\n","Fruitless negotiations continued between the governments of Bogotá and Quito, where the government of Bogotá did not recognize the separation of Ecuador or that of Cauca from the Gran Colombia until war broke out in May 1832.\n","In five months, New Granada defeated Ecuador due to the fact that the majority of the Ecuadorian Armed Forces were composed of rebellious angry unpaid veterans from Venezuela and Colombia that did not want to fight against their fellow countrymen.\n","The Treaty of Pasto of 1832 was signed by which the Department of Cauca was turned over to New Granada , the government of Bogotá recognized Ecuador as an independent country and the border was to follow the Ley de División Territorial de la República de Colombia  passed on 25 June 1824.\n","Later, Ecuador contended that the Republic of Colombia, while reorganizing its government, unlawfully made its eastern border provisional and that Colombia extended its claims south to the Napo River because it said that the Government of Popayán extended its control all the way to the Napo River.\n","When Ecuador seceded from the Gran Colombia, Peru decided not to follow the treaty of Guayaquil of 1829 or the protocoled agreements made.\n","Peru contested Ecuador's claims with the newly discovered Real Cedula of 1802, by which Peru claims the King of Spain had transferred these lands from the Viceroyalty of New Granada to the Viceroyalty of Peru.\n","Ecuador countered by labeling the Cedula of 1802 an ecclesiastical instrument, which had nothing to do with political borders.\n","Ecuador protested that it claimed the Amazon Basin between the Caqueta river and the Marañon-Amazon river.\n","Peru briefly occupied Guayaquil again in 1860, since Peru thought that Ecuador was selling some of the disputed land for development to British bond holders, but returned Guayaquil after a few months.\n","In the early part of the 20th century, Ecuador made an effort to peacefully define its eastern Amazonian borders with its neighbours through negotiation.\n","On 6 May 1904, Ecuador signed the Tobar-Rio Branco Treaty recognizing Brazil's claims to the Amazon in recognition of Ecuador's claim to be an Amazonian country to counter Peru's earlier Treaty with Brazil back on 23 October 1851.\n","Then after a few meetings with the Colombian government's representatives an agreement was reached and the Muñoz Vernaza-Suarez Treaty was signed 15 July 1916, in which Colombian rights to the Putumayo river were recognized as well as Ecuador's rights to the Napo river and the new border was a line that ran midpoint between those two rivers.\n","In this way, Ecuador gave up the claims it had to the Amazonian territories between the Caquetá River and Napo River to Colombia, thus cutting itself off from Brazil.\n","Ecuador protested this secret treaty, since Colombia gave away Ecuadorian claimed land to Peru that Ecuador had given to Colombia in 1916.\n","On 21 July 1924, the Ponce-Castro Oyanguren Protocol was signed between Ecuador and Peru where both agreed to hold direct negotiations and to resolve the dispute in an equitable manner and to submit the differing points of the dispute to the United States for arbitration.\n","Negotiations between the Ecuadorian and Peruvian representatives began in Washington on 30 September 1935.\n","Then on 6 February 1937, Ecuador presented a transactional line which Peru rejected the next day.\n","Peru claimed that Ecuador's military presence in Peruvian-claimed territory was an invasion; Ecuador, for its part, claimed that Peru had recently invaded Ecuador around the Zarumilla River and that Peru since Ecuador's independence from Spain has systematically occupied Tumbez, Jaen, and most of the disputed territories in the Amazonian Basin between the Putomayo and Marañon Rivers.\n","Peru had an army of 11,681 troops who faced a poorly supplied and inadequately armed Ecuadorian force of 2,300, of which only 1,300 were deployed in the southern provinces.\n","Hostilities erupted on 5 July 1941, when Peruvian forces crossed the Zarumilla river at several locations, testing the strength and resolve of the Ecuadorian border troops.\n","Finally, on 23 July 1941, the Peruvians launched a major invasion, crossing the Zarumilla river in force and advancing into the Ecuadorian province of El Oro.\n","During the course of the Ecuadorian–Peruvian War, Peru gained control over part of the disputed territory and some parts of the province of El Oro, and some parts of the province of Loja, demanding that the Ecuadorian government give up its territorial claims.\n","The Peruvian Navy blocked the port of Guayaquil, almost cutting all supplies to the Ecuadorian troops.\n","Ecuador and Peru came to an accord formalized in the Rio Protocol, signed on 29 January 1942, in favor of hemispheric unity against the Axis Powers in World War II favoring Peru with the territory they occupied at the time the war came to an end.\n","The 1944 Glorious May Revolution followed a military-civilian rebellion and a subsequent civic strike which successfully removed Carlos Arroyo del Río as a dictator from Ecuador's government.\n","However, a post-Second World War recession and popular unrest led to a return to populist politics and domestic military interventions in the 1960s, while foreign companies developed oil resources in the Ecuadorian Amazon.\n","The pipeline brought oil from the east side of the Andes to the coast, making Ecuador South America's second largest oil exporter.\n","The pipeline in southern Ecuador did nothing to resolve tensions between Ecuador and Peru, however.\n","The Rio Protocol failed to precisely resolve the border along a little river in the remote Cordillera del Cóndor region in southern Ecuador.\n","This caused a long-simmering dispute between Ecuador and Peru, which ultimately led to fighting between the two countries; first a border skirmish in January–February 1981 known as the Paquisha Incident, and ultimately full-scale warfare in January 1995 where the Ecuadorian military shot down Peruvian aircraft and helicopters and Peruvian infantry marched into southern Ecuador.\n","Sixto Durán Ballén, the Ecuadorian president,

history of Bangkok dates at least back to the early 15th century, to when it was a village on the west bank of the Chao Phraya River, under the rule of Ayutthaya.\n","Bangkok initially served as a customs outpost with forts on both sides of the river, and was the site of a siege in 1688 in which the French were expelled from Siam.\n","The City Pillar was erected on 21 April 1782, which is

1.8 million to 3 million in the 1960s.\n","Following the US withdrawal from Vietnam in 1973, Japanese businesses took over as leaders in investment, and the expansion of export-oriented manufacturing led to growth of the financial market in Bangkok.\n","Bangkok's role as the nation's political stage continues to be seen in strings of popular protests, from the student uprisings in 1973 and 1976,

geology of the Bangkok area is characterized by a top layer of soft marine clay, known as \"Bangkok clay\", averaging 15 metres  in thickness, which overlies an aquifer system consisting of eight known units.\n","Subsidence has resulted in increased flood risk, as Bangkok is already prone to flooding due to its low elevation and an inadequate drainage infrastructure, often compounded by blockage from rubbish pollution .\n","The city now relies on flood barriers and augmenting drainage from canals by pumping and building drain tunnels, but parts of Bangkok and its suburbs are still regularly inundated.\n","In 2011, most of Bangkok's northern, eastern and western districts were flooded, in some places for over two months.\n","Bangkok's coastal location makes it particularly

Americas, 5,856 from Oceania and 5,758 from Africa.\n","Following its establishment as capital city in 1782, Bangkok grew only slightly throughout the 18th and early 19th centuries.\n","As a result of

also part of the largest urban agglomeration in Africa, the Arab world and the Middle East: The Greater Cairo metropolitan area, with a population of 21.9 million, is the 12th-largest in the world by population.\n","Cairo is associated with ancient Egypt, as the Giza pyramid complex and the ancient cities of Memphis and Heliopolis are located in its geographical area.\n","Cairo has long been a centre of the region's political and cultural life, and is titled \"the city of a thousand minarets\" for its preponderance of Islamic architecture.\n","Cairo's historic center was awarded World

to Cairo as Maṣr mɑsˤɾ, the Egyptian Arabic name for Egypt itself, emphasizing the city's importance for the country.\n","Its official name al-Qāhirah   means 'the Vanquisher' or 'the Conqueror', supposedly due to the fact that the planet Mars, an-Najm al-Qāhir , was rising at the time when the city was founded, possibly also in reference to the much awaited arrival of the Fatimid Caliph Al-Mu'izz who reached Cairo in 973 from Mahdia, the old Fatimid capital.\n","Tikešrōmi di.kɑʃˈɾoːmi is attested in the 1211 text The Martyrdom of John of Phanijoit and is either a calque meaning 'man breaker' , akin to Arabic al-Qāhirah, or a derivation from Arabic قَصْر الرُوم , another name of Babylon Fortress in Old Cairo.\n","Some argue that Mistram ˈmɪs.təɾɑm or Nistram ˈnɪs.təɾɑm is another Coptic name for Cairo, although others think that it's rather a name of an Abbasid capital Al-Askar.\n","Some argue that it was a name of an Egyptian settlement upon which Cairo was built, but it is rather doubtful as this name is not attested in any Hieroglyphic or Demotic source, although some researchers, like Paul Casanova, view it as a legitimate theory.\n","Cairo is also referred to as Ⲭⲏⲙⲓ ˈkɪ.mi or Ⲅⲩⲡⲧⲟⲥ ˈɡɪp.dos, which means Egypt in Coptic, the same way it is referred to in Egyptian Arabic.\n","Sometimes the city is informally referred to as Cairo by people from Alexandria ˈkæjɾo.\n","The area around present-day Cairo had long been a focal point of Ancient Egypt due to its strategic location at the junction of the Nile Valley and the Nile Delta regions , which also placed it at the crossing of major routes between North Africa and the Levant.\n","Memphis, the capital of Egypt during the Old Kingdom and a major city up until the Ptolemaic period, was located a short distance south of present-day Cairo.\n","Heliopolis, another important city and major religious center, was located in what are now the northeastern suburbs of Cairo.\n","However, the origins of modern Cairo are generally traced back to a series of settlements in the first millennium AD.\n","Cairo's oldest extant churches, such as the Church of Saint Barbara and the Church of Saints Sergius and Bacchus , are located inside the fortress walls in what is now known as Old Cairo or Coptic Cairo.\n","Historians such as Janet Abu-Lughod and André Raymond trace the genesis of present-day Cairo to the foundation of Fustat.\n","Although it was repaired and given a new roof in later centuries, its basic structure is still preserved today, making it the oldest preserved Islamic-era structure in Cairo today.\n","Cairo would eventually become a centre of learning, with the library of Cairo containing hundreds of thousands of books.\n","When Caliph al-Mu'izz li Din Allah arrived from the old Fatimid capital of Mahdia in Tunisia in 973, he gave the city its present name, Qāhirat al-Mu'izz , from which the name \"Cairo\"  originates.\n","Cairo remained a relatively exclusive royal city for most of this era, but during the tenure of Badr al-Gamali as vizier  the restrictions were loosened for the first time and richer families from Fustat were allowed to move into the city.\n","Over the following centuries it was Cairo, the former palace-city, that became the new economic center and attracted migration from Fustat.\n","As the first Sultan of Egypt, Saladin established the Ayyubid dynasty, based in Cairo, and aligned Egypt with the Sunni Abbasids, who were based in Baghdad.\n","In 1176, Saladin began construction on the Cairo Citadel, which was to serve as the seat of the Egyptian government until the mid-19th century.\n","The construction of the Citadel definitively ended Fatimid-built Cairo's status as an exclusive palace-city and opened it up to common Egyptians and to foreign merchants, spurring its commercial development.\n","Along with the Citadel, Saladin also began the construction of a new 20-kilometre-long wall that would protect both Cairo and Fustat on their eastern side and connect them with the new Citadel.\n","Despite their military character, the Mamluks were also prolific builders and left a rich architectural legacy throughout Cairo.\n","Meanwhile, Cairo flourished as a centre of Islamic scholarship and a crossroads on the spice trade route among the civilisations in Afro-Eurasia.\n","Under the reign of the Mamluk sultan al-Nasir Muhammad , Cairo reached its apogee in terms of population and wealth.\n","By 1340, Cairo had a population of close to half a million, making it the largest city west of China.\n","When the

stagnation during the Late Middle Ages, it could not escape the Black Death, which struck the city more than fifty times between 1348 and 1517.\n","During its initial, and most deadly waves, approximately 200,000 people were killed by the plague, and, by the 15th century, Cairo's population had been reduced to between 150,000 and 300,000.\n","Though the plagues returned frequently throughout the 15th century, Cairo remained a major metropolis and its population recovered in part through rural migration.\n","He built or restored numerous monuments in Cairo, in addition to commissioning projects beyond Egypt.\n","The crisis of Mamluk power and of Cairo's economic role deepened after Qaytbay.\n","The city's status was diminished after Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route around the Cape of Good Hope between 1497 and 1499, thereby allowing spice traders to avoid Cairo.\n","Cairo's political influence diminished significantly after the Ottomans defeated Sultan al-Ghuri in the Battle of Marj Dabiq in 1516 and conquered Egypt in 1517.\n","Ruling from Constantinople, Sultan Selim I relegated Egypt to a province, with Cairo as its capital.\n","For this reason, the history of Cairo during Ottoman times is often described as inconsequential, especially in comparison to other time periods.\n","During the 16th and 17th centuries, Cairo still remained an important economic and cultural centre.\n","The first printing press of the Middle East, printing in Hebrew, was established in Cairo c. 1557 by a scion of the Soncino family of printers, Italian Jews of Ashkenazi origin who operated a press in Constantinople.\n","The existence of the press is known solely from two fragments discovered in the Cairo Genizah.\n","Under the Ottomans, Cairo expanded south and west from its nucleus around the Citadel.\n","The city was the second-largest in the empire, behind Constantinople, and, although migration was not the primary source of Cairo's growth, twenty percent of its population at the end of the 18th century consisted of religious minorities and foreigners from around the Mediterranean.\n","Still, when Napoleon arrived in Cairo in 1798, the city's population was less than 300,000, forty percent lower than it was at the height of Mamluk—and Cairene—influence in the mid-14th century.\n","Cairo itself was besieged by a British and Ottoman force culminating with the French surrender on 22 June 1801.\n","However, while Muhammad Ali initiated the construction of public buildings in the city, those reforms had minimal effect on Cairo's landscape.\n","Bigger changes came to Cairo under Isma'il Pasha , who continued the modernisation processes started by his grandfather.\n","Drawing inspiration from Paris, Isma'il envisioned a city of maidans and wide avenues; due to financial constraints, only some of them, in the area now composing Downtown Cairo, came to fruition.\n","The city's economic centre quickly moved west toward the Nile, away from the historic Islamic Cairo section and toward the contemporary, European-style areas built by Isma'il.\n","Europeans accounted for five percent of Cairo's population at the end of the 19th century, by which point they held most top governmental positions.\n","In 1906 the Heliopolis Oasis Company headed by the Belgian industrialist Édouard Empain and his Egyptian counterpart Boghos Nubar, built a suburb called Heliopolis  ten kilometers from the center of Cairo.\n","In 1905–1907 the northern part of the Gezira island was developed by the Baehler Company into Zamalek, which would later become Cairo's upscale \"chic\" neighbourhood.\n","Nationalists staged large-scale demonstrations in Cairo in 1919, five years after Egypt had been declared a British protectorate.\n","The King Fuad I Edition of the Qur'an was first published on 10 July 1924 in Cairo under the patronage of King Fuad.\n","During this time, urban Cairo, spurred by new bridges and transport links, continued to expand to include the upscale neighbourhoods of Garden City, Zamalek, and Heliopolis.\n","Between 1882 and 1937, the population of Cairo more than tripled—from 347,000 to 1.3 million—and its area increased from 10 to 163 km2 .\n","The city was devastated during the 1952 riots known as the Cairo Fire or Black Saturday, which saw the destruction of nearly 700 shops, movie theatres, casinos and hotels in downtown Cairo.\n","The British departed Cairo following the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, but the city's rapid growth showed no signs of abating.\n","In the second half of the 20th century Cairo continue to grow enormously in both population and area.\n","Between 1947 and 2006 the population of Greater Cairo went from 2,986,280 to 16,292,269.\n","By 2009, over 63% of the population of Greater Cairo lived in informal neighbourhoods, even though these occupied only 17% of the total area of Greater Cairo.\n","According to economist David Sims, informal housing has the benefits of providing affordable accommodation and vibrant communities to huge numbers of Cairo's working classes, but it also suffers from government neglect, a relative lack of services, and overcrowding.\n","Starting in 1977 the Egyptian government established the New Urban Communities Authority to initiate and direct the development of new planned cities on the outskirts of Cairo, generally established on desert land.\n","As of 2014, about 10% of the population of Greater Cairo lived in the new cities.\n","Concurrently, Cairo established itself as a political and economic hub for North Africa and the Arab world, with many multinational businesses and organisations, including the Arab League, operating out of the city.\n","In 1979 the historic districts of Cairo were listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n","In 1992, Cairo was hit by an earthquake causing 545 deaths, injuring 6,512 and leaving around 50,000 people homeless.\n","Cairo's Tahrir Square was the focal point of the 2011 Egyptian Revolution against former president Hosni Mubarak.\n","Over 2 million protesters were at Cairo's Tahrir square.\n","In the following days Tahrir Square continued to be the primary destination for protests in Cairo as it took place following a popular uprising that began on Tuesday, 25 January 2011 and continued until June 2013.\n","The uprising took place in Cairo, Alexandria, and in other cities in Egypt, following the Tunisian revolution that resulted in the overthrow of the long-time Tunisian president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.\n","Under the rule of President el-Sisi, in March 2015 plans were announced for another yet-unnamed planned city to be built further east of the existing satellite city of New Cairo, intended to serve as the new capital of Egypt.\n","Cairo is located in northern Egypt, known as Lower Egypt, 165 km  south of the Mediterranean Sea and 120 km  west of the Gulf of Suez and Suez Canal.\n","Although the Cairo metropolis extends away from the Nile in all directions, the city of Cairo resides only on the east bank of the river and two islands within it on a total area of 453 km2 .\n","Geologically, Cairo lies on alluvium and sand dunes which date from the quaternary period.\n","Until the mid-19th century, when the river was tamed by dams, levees, and other controls, the Nile in the vicinity of Cairo was highly susceptible to changes in course and surface level.\n","The land on which Cairo was established in 969  was located underwater just over three hundred years earlier, when Fustat was first built.\n","Low periods of the Nile during the 11th century continued to add to the landscape of Cairo; a new island, known as Geziret al-Fil, first appeared in 1174, but eventually became connected to the mainland.\n","Because of the Nile's movement, the newer parts of the city—Garden City, Downtown Cairo, and Zamalek—are located closest to the riverbank.\n","The areas, which are home to most of Cairo's embassies, are surrounded on the north, east, and south by the older parts of the city.\n","Old Cairo, located south of the centre, holds the remnants of Fustat and the heart of Egypt's Coptic Christian community, Coptic Cairo.\n","The Citadel is located east of the city centre around Islamic Cairo, which dates back to the Fatimid era and the foundation of Cairo.\n","While western Cairo is dominated by wide boulevards, open spaces, and modern architecture of European influence, the eastern half, having grown haphazardly over the centuries, is dominated by small lanes, crowded tenements, and Islamic architecture.\n","Northern and extreme eastern parts of Cairo, which include satellite towns, are among the most recent additions to the city, as they developed in the late-20th and early-21st centuries to accommodate the city's rapid growth.\n","The western bank of the Nile is commonly included within the urban area of Cairo, but it composes the city of Giza and the Giza Governorate.\n","The Cairo Governorate was just north of the Helwan Governorate from 2008 when some Cairo's southern districts, including Maadi and New Cairo, were split off and annexed into the new governorate, to 2011 when the Helwan Governorate was reincorporated into the Cairo Governorate.\n","According to the World Health Organization, the level of air pollution in Cairo is nearly 12 times higher than the recommended safety level.\n","In Cairo, and along the Nile River Valley, the climate is a hot desert climate 161.\n","Snowfall is extremely rare; a small amount of graupel, widely believed to be snow, fell on Cairo's easternmost suburbs on 13 December 2013, the first time Cairo's area received this kind of precipitation in many decades.\n","The city of Cairo forms part of Greater Cairo, the largest metropolitan area in Africa.\n","While it has no administrative body, the Ministry of Planning considers it as an economic region consisting of Cairo Governorate, Giza

14th-most populated country in the world, and the third-most populated in Africa, behind Nigeria and Ethiopia.\n","Egypt has one of the longest histories of any country, tracing its heritage along the Nile Delta back to the 6th–4th millennia BCE.\n","Considered a cradle of civilisation, Ancient Egypt saw some of the earliest developments of writing, agriculture, urbanisation, organised religion and central government.\n","Egypt's long and rich cultural heritage is an integral part of its national identity, which reflects its unique transcontinental location being simultaneously Mediterranean, Middle Eastern and North African.\n","Egypt was an early and important centre of Christianity, but was largely Islamised in the seventh century and remains a predominantly Sunni Muslim country, albeit with a significant Christian minority, along with other lesser practiced faiths.\n","Modern Egypt dates back to 1922, when it gained independence from the British Empire as a monarchy.\n","Following

Akkadian \"mi-iṣ-ru\"  related to miṣru/miṣirru/miṣaru, meaning \"border\" or \"frontier\".\n","Climate changes or overgrazing around 8000 BCE began to desiccate the pastoral lands of Egypt, forming the Sahara.\n","During the Neolithic era, several predynastic cultures developed independently in Upper and Lower Egypt.\n","The Badarian culture and the successor Naqada series are generally regarded as precursors to dynastic Egypt.\n","The earliest known Lower Egyptian site, Merimda, predates the Badarian by about seven hundred years.\n","Contemporaneous Lower Egyptian communities coexisted with their southern counterparts for more than two thousand years, remaining culturally distinct, but maintaining frequent contact through trade.\n","The earliest known evidence of Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions appeared during the predynastic period on Naqada III pottery vessels, dated to about 3200 BCE.\n","A unified kingdom was founded c. 3150 BCE by King Menes, leading to a series of dynasties that ruled Egypt for the next three millennia.\n","Egyptian culture flourished during this long period and remained distinctively Egyptian in its religion, arts, language and customs.\n","The first two ruling dynasties of a unified Egypt set the stage for the Old Kingdom period, c. 2700–2200 BCE, which constructed many pyramids, most notably the Third Dynasty pyramid of Djoser and the Fourth Dynasty Giza pyramids.\n","A second period of disunity heralded the arrival of the first foreign ruling dynasty in Egypt, that of the Semitic Hyksos.\n","The Hyksos invaders took over much of Lower Egypt around 1650 BCE and founded a new capital at Avaris.\n","They were driven out by an Upper Egyptian force led by Ahmose I, who founded the Eighteenth Dynasty and relocated the capital from Memphis to Thebes.\n","The New Kingdom c. 1550–1070 BCE began with the Eighteenth Dynasty, marking the rise of Egypt as an international power that expanded during its greatest extension to an empire as far south as Tombos in Nubia, and included parts of the Levant in the east.\n","The country was later invaded and conquered by Libyans, Nubians and Assyrians, but native Egyptians eventually drove them out and regained control of their country.\n","In 525 BCE, the powerful Achaemenid Persians, led by Cambyses II, began their conquest of Egypt, eventually capturing the pharaoh Psamtik III at the battle of Pelusium.\n","Cambyses II then assumed the formal title of pharaoh, but ruled Egypt from his home of Susa in Persia , leaving Egypt under the control of a satrapy.\n","The entire Twenty-seventh Dynasty of Egypt, from 525 to 402 BCE, save for Petubastis III, was an entirely Persian-ruled period, with the Achaemenid Emperors all being granted the title of pharaoh.\n","A few temporarily successful revolts against the Persians marked the fifth century BCE, but Egypt was never able to permanently overthrow the Persians.\n","This Thirty-first Dynasty of Egypt, however, did not last long, as the Persians were toppled several decades later by Alexander the Great.\n","To gain recognition by the native Egyptian populace, they named themselves as the successors to the Pharaohs.\n","The later Ptolemies took on Egyptian traditions, had themselves portrayed on public monuments in Egyptian style and dress, and participated in Egyptian religious life.\n","The Ptolemies faced rebellions of native Egyptians often caused by an unwanted regime and were involved in foreign and civil wars that led to the decline of the kingdom and its annexation by Rome.\n","Nevertheless, Hellenistic culture continued to thrive in Egypt well after the Muslim conquest.\n","Christianity was brought to Egypt by Saint Mark the Evangelist in the 1st century.\n","Diocletian's reign  marked the transition from the Roman to the Byzantine era in Egypt, when a great number of Egyptian Christians were persecuted.\n","The New Testament had by then been translated into Egyptian.\n","After the Council of Chalcedon in CE 451, a distinct Egyptian Coptic Church was firmly established.\n","The Byzantines were able to regain control of the country after a brief Sasanid Persian invasion early in the 7th century amidst the Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628 during which they established a new short-lived province for ten years known as Sasanian Egypt, until 639–42, when Egypt was invaded and\n","conquered by the Islamic caliphate by the Muslim Arabs.\n","When they defeated the Byzantine armies in Egypt, the Arabs brought Islam to the country.\n","Some time during this period, Egyptians began to blend in their new faith with indigenous beliefs and practices, leading to various Sufi orders that have flourished to this day.\n","In 639 an army of around 4,000 men were sent in Egypt by the second caliph, Umar, under the command of Amr ibn al-As.\n","The Arabs founded the capital of Egypt called Fustat, which was later burned down during the Crusades.\n","At the beginning of the 9th century the practice of ruling Egypt through a governor was resumed under Abdallah ibn Tahir, who decided to reside at Baghdad, sending a deputy to Egypt to govern for him.\n","In 828 another Egyptian revolt broke out, and in 831 the Copts joined with native Muslims against the government.\n","Eventually the power loss of the Abbasids in Baghdad has led for general upon general to take over rule of Egypt, yet being under Abbasid allegiance, the Tulunid dynasty  and Ikhshidid dynasty  were among the most successful to defy the Abbasid Caliph.\n","Muslim rulers remained in control of Egypt for the next six centuries, with Cairo as the seat of the Fatimid Caliphate.\n","By the late 13th century, Egypt linked the Red Sea, India, Malaya, and East Indies.\n","Egypt was conquered by the Ottoman Turks in 1517, after which it became a province of the Ottoman Empire.\n","The weakening of the economic system combined with the effects of plague left Egypt vulnerable to foreign invasion.\n","Between 1687 and 1731, Egypt experienced six famines.\n","Egypt was always a difficult province for the Ottoman Sultans to control, due in part to the continuing power and influence of the Mamluks, the Egyptian military caste who had ruled the country for centuries.\n","Egypt remained semi-autonomous under the Mamluks until it was invaded by the French forces of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1798 .\n","After the French were defeated by the British, a power vacuum was created in Egypt, and a three-way power struggle ensued between the Ottoman Turks, Egyptian Mamluks who had ruled Egypt for centuries, and Albanian mercenaries in the service of the Ottomans.\n","After the French were expelled, power was seized in 1805 by Muhammad Ali Pasha, an Albanian military commander of the Ottoman army in Egypt.\n","While he carried the title of viceroy of Egypt, his subordination to the Ottoman porte was merely nominal.\n","Muhammad Ali massacred the Mamluks and established a dynasty that was to rule Egypt until the revolution of 1952.\n","He constructed a military state with around four percent of the populace serving the army to raise Egypt to a powerful positioning in the Ottoman Empire in a way showing various similarities to the Soviet strategies  conducted in the 20th century.\n","He introduced conscription of the male peasantry in 19th century Egypt, and took a novel approach to create his great army, strengthening it with numbers and in skill.\n","It was with the help of this newly reborn martial unit that Muhammad Ali imposed his rule over Egypt.\n","The policy that Mohammad Ali Pasha followed during his reign explains partly why the numeracy in Egypt compared to other North-African and Middle-Eastern countries increased only at a remarkably small rate, as investment in further education only took place in the military and industrial sector.\n","Muhammad Ali was succeeded briefly by his son Ibrahim , then by a grandson Abbas I , then by Said , and Isma'il  who encouraged science and agriculture and banned slavery in Egypt.\n","Egypt under the Muhammad Ali dynasty remained nominally an Ottoman province.\n","In 1875 Isma'il avoided bankruptcy by selling all Egypt's shares in the canal to the British government.\n","Within three years this led to the imposition of British and French controllers who sat in the Egyptian cabinet, and, \"with the financial power of the bondholders behind them, were the real power in the Government.\n","Other circumstances like epidemic diseases , floods and wars drove the economic downturn and increased Egypt's dependency on foreign debt even further.\n","After increasing tensions and nationalist revolts, the United Kingdom invaded Egypt in 1882, crushing the Egyptian army at the Battle of Tell El Kebir and militarily occupying the country.\n","In 1899 the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium Agreement was signed: the Agreement stated that Sudan would be jointly governed by the Khedivate of Egypt and the United Kingdom.\n","In 1906, the Denshawai incident prompted many neutral Egyptians to join the nationalist movement.\n","Hussein Kamel declared Egypt's independence from the Ottoman Empire, assuming the title of Sultan of Egypt.\n","Shortly following independence, Egypt was declared a protectorate of the United Kingdom.\n","After World War I, Saad Zaghlul and the Wafd Party led the Egyptian nationalist movement to a majority at the local Legislative Assembly.\n","The revolt led the UK government to issue a unilateral declaration of Egypt's independence on 22 February 1922.\n","Following independence from the United Kingdom, Sultan Fuad I assumed the title of King of Egypt; despite being nominally independent, the Kingdom was still under British military occupation and the UK still had great influence over the state.\n","In 1936, the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty was concluded and British troops withdrew from Egypt, except for the Suez Canal.\n","The treaty did not resolve the question of Sudan, which, under the terms of the existing Anglo-Egyptian Condominium Agreement of 1899, stated that Sudan should be jointly governed by Egypt and Britain, but with real power remaining in British hands.\n","Britain used Egypt as a base for Allied operations throughout the region, especially the battles in North Africa against Italy and Germany.\n","The government of Egypt, and the Egyptian population, played a minor role in the Second World War.\n","When the war began in September 1939, Egypt declared martial law and broke off diplomatic relations with Germany.\n","It did not declare war on Germany, but the Prime Minister associated Egypt with the British war effort.\n","It broke diplomatic relations with Italy in 1940, but never declared war, even when the Italian army invaded Egypt.\n","King Farouk took practically a neutral position, which accorded with elite opinion among the Egyptians.\n","The Egyptian army did no fighting.\n","However, the humiliation meted out to Farouk, and the actions of the Wafd in cooperating with the British and taking power, lost support for both the British and the Wafd among both civilians and, more importantly, the Egyptian military.\n","In 1951 Egypt unilaterally withdrew from the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936 and ordered all remaining British troops to leave the Suez Canal.\n","As the British refused to leave their base around the Suez Canal, the Egyptian government cut off the water and refused to allow food into the Suez Canal base, announced a boycott of British goods, forbade Egyptian workers from entering the base and sponsored guerrilla attacks, turning the area around the Suez Canal into a low level war zone.\n","On 24 January 1952, Egyptian guerrillas staged a fierce attack on the British forces around the Suez Canal, during which the Egyptian Auxiliary Police were observed helping the guerrillas.\n","The resulting battle saw the police station levelled and 43 Egyptian policemen killed together with 3 British soldiers.\n","The Ismailia incident outraged Egypt.\n","On 22–23 July 1952, the Free Officers Movement, led by Muhammad Naguib and Gamal Abdel Nasser, launched a coup d'état  against the king.\n","The Royal Family left Egypt some days later and the Council of Regency, led by Prince Muhammad Abdel Moneim was formed, The council, however, held only nominal authority and the real power was actually in the hands of the Revolutionary Command Council, led by Naguib and Nasser.\n","Following a brief experiment with civilian rule, the Free Officers abrogated the monarchy and the 1923 constitution and declared Egypt a republic on 18 June 1953.\n","Following the 1952 Revolution by the Free Officers Movement, the rule of Egypt passed to military hands and all political parties were banned.\n","On 18 June 1953, the Egyptian Republic was declared, with General Muhammad Naguib as the first President of the Republic, serving in that capacity for a little under one and a half years.\n","In October 1954 Egypt and the United Kingdom agreed to abolish the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium Agreement of 1899 and grant Sudan independence; the agreement came into force on 1 January 1956.\n","In 1958, Egypt and Syria formed a sovereign union known as the United Arab Republic.\n","In 1959, the All-Palestine Government of the Gaza Strip, an Egyptian client state, was absorbed into the United Arab Republic under the pretext of Arab union, and was never restored.\n","In the early 1960s, Egypt became fully involved in the North Yemen Civil War.\n","The Egyptian President, Gamal Abdel Nasser, supported the Yemeni republicans with as many as 70,000 Egyptian troops and chemical weapons.\n","Egyptian commitment in Yemen was greatly undermined later.\n","This prompted the beginning of the Third Arab Israeli War  in which Israel attacked Egypt, and occupied Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza Strip, which Egypt had occupied since the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.\n","At the time of the fall of the Egyptian monarchy in the early 1950s, less than half a million Egyptians were considered upper class and rich, four million middle class and 17 million lower class and poor.\n","Millions of previously poor Egyptians, through education and jobs in the public sector, joined the middle class.\n","Doctors, engineers, teachers, lawyers, journalists, constituted the bulk of the swelling middle class in Egypt under Nasser.\n","During the 1960s, the Egyptian economy went from sluggish to the verge of collapse, the society became less free, and Nasser's appeal waned considerably.\n","Sadat switched Egypt's Cold War allegiance from the Soviet Union to the United States, expelling Soviet advisors in 1972.\n","In 1973, Egypt, along with Syria, launched the Fourth Arab-Israeli War , a surprise attack to regain part of the Sinai territory Israel had captured 6 years earlier.\n","Eventually Israel won the war, but early successes restored Egypt's confidence and morale, allowing Sadat to later regain Sinai in exchange for peace with Israel.\n","Through this policy, incentives such as reduced taxes and import tariffs attracted some investors, but investments were mainly directed at low risk and profitable ventures like tourism and construction, abandoning Egypt's infant industries.\n","Even though Sadat's policy was intended to modernise Egypt and assist the middle class, it mainly benefited the higher class, and, because of the elimination of subsidies on basic foodstuffs, led to the 1977 Egyptian Bread Riots.\n","Sadat made a historic visit to Israel in 1977, which led to the 1979 Egypt-Israel peace treaty in exchange for Israeli withdrawal from Sinai.\n","In return, Egypt recognized Israel as a legitimate sovereign state.\n","Sadat's initiative sparked enormous controversy in the Arab world and led to Egypt's expulsion from the Arab League, but it was supported by most Egyptians.\n","Hosni Mubarak reaffirmed Egypt's relationship with Israel yet eased the tensions with Egypt's Arab neighbours.\n","In the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, terrorist attacks in Egypt became numerous and severe, and began to target Christian Copts, foreign tourists and government officials.\n","Serious damage was done to the largest sector of Egypt's economy—tourism—and in turn to the government, but it also devastated the livelihoods of many of the people on whom the group depended for support.\n","Human Rights Watch's 2006 report on Egypt detailed serious human rights violations, including routine torture, arbitrary detentions and trials before military and state security courts.\n","In 2007, Amnesty International released a report alleging that Egypt had become an international centre for torture, where other nations send suspects for interrogation, often as part of the War on Terror.\n","Egypt's foreign ministry quickly issued a rebuttal to this report.\n","In 2009, Dr. Ali El Deen Hilal Dessouki, Media Secretary of the National Democratic Party , described Egypt as a \"pharaonic\" political system, and democracy as a \"long-term goal\".\n","Dessouki also stated that \"the real center of power in Egypt is the military\".\n","The Egyptian military then assumed the power to govern.\n","On 28 November 2011, Egypt held its first parliamentary election since the previous regime had been in power.\n","On 30 June 2012, Mohamed Morsi was sworn in as Egypt’s president.\n","On 2 August 2012, Egypt's Prime Minister Hisham Qandil announced his 35-member cabinet comprising 28 newcomers, including four from the Muslim Brotherhood.\n","The move led to massive protests and violent action throughout Egypt.\n","On 4 July 2013, 68-year-old Chief Justice of the Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt Adly Mansour was sworn in as acting president over the new government following the removal of Morsi.\n","The new Egyptian authorities cracked down on the Muslim Brotherhood and its supporters, jailing thousands and forcefully dispersing pro-Morsi and pro-Brotherhood protests.\n","On 26 March 2014, Field Marshal Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, Egyptian Defence Minister and Commander-in-Chief Egyptian Armed Forces, retired from the military, announcing he would stand as a candidate in the 2014 presidential election.\n","Sisi was sworn into office as President of Egypt on 8 June 2014.\n","In 2016, Egypt entered in a diplomatic crisis with Italy following the murder of researcher Giulio Regeni: in April 2016, Prime Minister Matteo Renzi recalled the Italian ambassador from Cairo because of lack of co-operation from the Egyptian Government in the investigation.\n","The ambassador was sent back to Egypt in 2017 by the new Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni.\n","The dispute between Egypt and Ethiopia over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam escalated in 2020.\n","Egypt sees the dam as an existential threat, fearing that the dam will reduce the amount of water it receives from the Nile.\n","In December 2020, final results of the parliamentary election confirmed a clear majority of the seats for Egypt’s Mostaqbal Watn  Party, which strongly supports president el-Sisi.\n","Egypt lies primarily between latitudes 22° and 32°N, and longitudes 25° and 35°E.\n","Due to the extreme aridity of Egypt's climate, population centres are concentrated along the narrow Nile Valley and Delta, meaning that about 99% of the population uses about 5.5% of the total land area.\n","of Egyptians live on 3% of the territory.\n","Egypt is bordered by Libya to the west, the Sudan to the south, and

urbanisation rate remains one of the lowest in the world, and in 2017, over 130 million Pakistanis  lived in rural areas.\n","Due to a high fertility rate, estimated at 3.5 in 2022, Pakistan has one of the world's youngest populations.\n","The 2017 census recorded that 40.3% of the country's population was under the age of 15, while only 3.7% of Pakistanis were aged 65 or more.\n","Pakistan is a multicultural, multi-linguistic, and multiethnic society.\n","Despite Urdu being Pakistan's lingua franca, estimates on how many languages are spoken in the country range from 75 to 85, Urdu—the lingua franca and a symbol of Muslim identity and national unity—is the national language and understood by over 75% of Pakistanis.\n","Urdu and English are the official languages of Pakistan.\n","English is primarily used in official business and government, and in legal contracts; the local variety is known as Pakistani English.\n","According to the 2017 national census of Pakistan, the country's largest ethnolinguistic groups were the Punjabis , the Pashtuns , Sindhis , Saraikis , Muhajirs , and the Balochs .\n","There is also a large Pakistani diaspora worldwide, numbering over seven million, which has been recorded as the sixth largest diaspora in the world.\n","Even after partition in 1947, Indian Muslims continued to migrate to Pakistan throughout the 1950s and 1960s, and these migrants settled mainly in Karachi and other towns of Sindh province.\n","The wars in neighboring Afghanistan during the 1980s and 1990s also forced millions of Afghan refugees into Pakistan.\n","Sweden, formally the Kingdom of Sweden, is a Nordic country located on the Scandinavian Peninsula in Northern Europe.\n","At 447,425 square kilometres , Sweden is the largest Nordic country, the third-largest country in the European Union, and the fifth-largest country in Europe.\n","Sweden has a total population of 10.5 million, and a low population density of 25.5 inhabitants per square kilometre , with around 87% of Swedes residing in urban areas, which cover 1.5% of the entire land area, in the central and southern half of the country.\n","Nature in Sweden is dominated by forests and many lakes, including some of the largest in Europe.\n","With the country ranging from 55°N to 69°N, the climate of Sweden is diverse due to the length of the country.\n","Germanic peoples have inhabited Sweden since prehistoric times, emerging into history as the Geats  and Swedes  and constituting the sea peoples known as the Norsemen.\n","This led to the formation of the Scandinavian Kalmar Union in 1397, which Sweden left in 1523.\n","When Sweden became involved in the Thirty Years' War on the Protestant side, an expansion of its territories began, forming the Swedish Empire, which remained one of the great powers of Europe until the early 18th century.\n","The last war in which Sweden was directly involved was in 1814 when Norway was militarily forced into a personal union, which peacefully dissolved in 1905.\n","In 2014, Sweden celebrated 200 years of peace, a longer span of peacetime than even Switzerland.\n","Sweden maintained an official policy of neutrality during wartime and non-participation in military alliances during peacetime, although Sweden secretly relied on U.S. nuclear submarines during the Cold War.\n","Sweden has since 2008 joined EU battlegroups, provided intelligence to NATO and since 2009 openly moved towards cooperation with NATO.\n","Sweden is a highly developed country ranked seventh in the Human Development Index, it is a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary democracy, with legislative power vested in the 349-member unicameral Riksdag.\n","Sweden maintains a Nordic social welfare system that provides universal health care and tertiary education for its citizens.\n","Sweden joined the European Union on 1 January 1995 but rejected Eurozone membership following a referendum.\n","The name for Sweden is generally agreed to derive from the Proto-Indo-European root *se, meaning \"one's own\", referring to one's own tribe from the tribal period.\n","Sweden's prehistory begins in the Allerød oscillation, a warm period around 12,000 BC, with Late Palaeolithic reindeer-hunting camps of the Bromme culture at the edge of the ice in what is now the country's southernmost province, Scania.\n","Sweden and its people were first described by Publius Cornelius Tacitus in his written work Germania .\n","As for literacy in Sweden itself, the runic script was in use among the south Scandinavian elite by at least the second century AD, but all that has come down to the present from the Roman Period is curt inscriptions on artefacts, mainly of male names, demonstrating that the people of south Scandinavia spoke Proto-Norse at the time, a language ancestral to Swedish and other North Germanic languages.\n","The actions of these Swedish Vikings are commemorated on many runestones in Sweden, such as the Greece runestones and the Varangian runestones.\n","It is not known when and how the kingdom of Sweden was born, but the list of Swedish monarchs is drawn from the first kings known to have ruled both Svealand  and Götaland  as one province, beginning with Eric the Victorious.\n","Sweden and Gothia were two separate nations long before that and since antiquity.\n","Saint Ansgar is usually credited with introducing Christianity to Sweden in 829, but the new religion did not begin to fully replace paganism until the 12th century.\n","During the 11th century, Christianity became the prevalent religion, and from 1050 Sweden is counted as a Christian nation.\n","In the years 1150–1293 according to the legend of Eric IX and the Eric Chronicles Swedish kings made a first, second and third crusade to pagan Finland against Finns, Tavastians, and Karelians and started conflicts with the Rus' who no longer had any connection with Sweden.\n","Except for the provinces of Scania, Blekinge and Halland in the south-west of the Scandinavian peninsula, which were parts of the Kingdom of Denmark during this time, feudalism never developed in Sweden as it did in the rest of Europe.\n","Slavery  was not common in Sweden, and what slavery there was tended to be driven out of existence by the spread of Christianity, by the difficulty of obtaining slaves from lands east of the Baltic Sea, and by the development of cities before the 16th century.\n","Still, Sweden remained a poor and economically backward country in which barter was the primary means of exchange.\n","For instance, the farmers of the province of Dalsland would transport their butter to the mining districts of Sweden and exchange it there for iron, which they would then take to the coast and trade for fish, which they consumed, while the iron would be shipped abroad.\n","In the middle of the 14th century, Sweden was struck by the Black Death.\n","The population of Sweden and most of Europe was decimated.\n","In 1319, Sweden and Norway were united under King Magnus Eriksson, and in 1397 Queen Margaret I of Denmark affected the personal union of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark through the Kalmar Union.\n","King Christian II of Denmark, who asserted his claim to Sweden by force of arms, ordered a massacre of Swedish nobles in Stockholm in 1520.\n","This came to be known as the \"Stockholm blood bath\" and stirred the Swedish nobility to new resistance and, on 6 June  in 1523, they made Gustav Vasa their king.\n","This is sometimes considered as the foundation of modern Sweden.\n","Shortly afterwards the new king rejected Catholicism and led Sweden into the Protestant Reformation.\n","With these concessions, Lübeck merchants flocked to Stockholm, where they soon came to dominate the city's economic life and made the port city of Stockholm into the leading commercial and industrial city of Sweden.\n","The main exports from Sweden were iron and copper.\n","Furthermore, when Sweden did develop, freed itself from the Hanseatic League, and entered its golden era, the fact that the peasantry had traditionally been free meant that more of the economic benefits flowed back to them rather than going to a feudal landowning class.\n","His despotic rule, strongly characterised by intolerance towards the Protestants, sparked a civil war that plunged Sweden into poverty.\n","In opposition, Sigismund's uncle and successor, Charles Vasa, summoned the Uppsala Synod in 1593 which officially confirmed the modern Church of Sweden as Lutheran.\n","Following his deposition in 1599, Sigismund attempted to reclaim the throne at every expense and hostilities between Poland and Sweden continued for the next one hundred years.\n","During the 17th century, Sweden emerged as a European great power.\n","Before the emergence of the Swedish Empire, Sweden was a poor and sparsely populated country on the fringe of European civilisation, with no significant power or reputation.\n","Sweden rose to prominence on a continental scale during the reign of king Gustavus Adolphus, seizing territories from Russia and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in multiple conflicts, including the Thirty Years' War.\n","During the Thirty Years' War, Sweden conquered approximately half of the Holy Roman states and defeated the Imperial army at the Battle of Breitenfeld in 1631.\n","After the Battle of Nördlingen in 1634, Sweden's only significant military defeat of the war, pro-Swedish sentiment among the German states faded.\n","These German provinces broke away from Swedish power one by one, leaving Sweden with only a few northern German territories: Swedish Pomerania, Bremen-Verden and Wismar.\n","From 1643 to 1645, during the last years of the war, Sweden and Denmark-Norway fought the Torstenson War.\n","The result of that conflict and the conclusion of the Thirty Years' War helped establish postwar Sweden as a major force in Europe.\n","In the middle of the 17th century, Sweden was the third-largest country in Europe by land area, surpassed by only Russia and Spain.\n","Sweden reached its largest territorial extent under the rule of Charles X after the treaty of Roskilde in 1658, following Charles X's risky but successful crossing of the Danish Belts.\n","The foundation of Sweden's success during this period is credited to Gustav I's major changes to the Swedish economy in the 16th century, and his introduction of Protestantism.\n","In the 17th century, Sweden was engaged in many wars, for example with Poland–Lithuania, with both sides competing for territories of today's Baltic states, with Sweden suffering a notable defeat at the Battle of Kircholm.\n","Famine also hit Sweden, killing roughly 10% of Sweden's population.\n","His legacy to his son, the coming ruler of Sweden, Charles XII, was one of the finest arsenals in the world, a large standing army and a great fleet.\n","Russia, the most serious threat to Sweden at this time, had a larger army but lagged far behind in both equipment and training.\n","After the Battle of Narva in 1700, one of the first battles of the Great Northern War, the Russian army was so severely devastated that Sweden had an open chance to invade Russia.\n","In addition, the plague raging in East Central Europe devastated the Swedish dominions and reached Central Sweden in 1710.\n","Returning to Sweden in 1715, Charles XII launched two campaigns against Norway on 1716 and 1718, respectively.\n","Forced to cede large areas of land in the Treaty of Nystad in 1721, Sweden also lost its place as an empire and as the dominant state on the Baltic Sea.\n","With Sweden's lost influence, Russia emerged as an empire and became one of Europe's dominant nations.\n","As the war finally ended in 1721, Sweden had lost an estimated 200,000 men, 150,000 of those from the area of present-day Sweden and 50,000 from the Finnish part of Sweden.\n","In the 18th century, Sweden did not have enough resources to maintain its territories outside Scandinavia, and most of them were lost, culminating with the loss in 1809 of eastern Sweden to Russia, which became the highly autonomous Grand Principality of Finland in Imperial Russia.\n","In interest of re-establishing Swedish dominance in the Baltic Sea, Sweden allied itself against its traditional ally and benefactor, France, in the Napoleonic Wars.\n","Sweden's role in the Battle of Leipzig gave it the authority to force Denmark–Norway, an ally of France, to cede Norway to the King of Sweden on 14 January 1814 in exchange for the northern German provinces, at the Treaty of Kiel.\n","He launched a military campaign against Norway on 27 July 1814, ending in the Convention of Moss, which forced Norway into a personal union with Sweden under the Swedish crown, which lasted until 1905.\n","The 1814 campaign was the last time Sweden was at war.\n","The obvious choice of home port was Gothenburg at Sweden's west coast, the mouth of Göta älv river is very wide and has the county's largest and best harbour for high-seas journeys.\n","The trade continued into the 19th century, and caused the little town to become Sweden's second city.\n","Between 1750 and 1850, the population in Sweden doubled.\n","Nevertheless, Sweden remained poor, retaining a nearly entirely agricultural economy even as Denmark and Western European countries began to industrialise.\n","In the early 20th century, more Swedes lived in Chicago than in Gothenburg .\n","Between 1870 and 1914, Sweden began developing the industrialised economy that exists today.\n","Strong grassroots movements sprang up in Sweden during the latter half of the 19th century , creating a strong foundation of democratic principles.\n","These movements precipitated Sweden's migration into a modern parliamentary democracy, achieved by the time of World War I.\n","Sweden was officially neutral during World War I.\n","Sweden also allowed volunteers to fight for the White Guards alongside the Germans against the Red Guards and Russians in the Finnish Civil War, and briefly occupied Åland in cooperation with the German Empire.\n","As in the First World War, Sweden remained officially neutral during World War II, although its neutrality during World War II has been disputed.\n","Sweden was under German influence for much of the war, as ties to the rest of the world were cut off through blockades.\n","Sweden also supplied steel and machined parts to Germany throughout the war.\n","However, Sweden supported Norwegian resistance against Germany, and in 1943 helped rescue Danish Jews from deportation to Nazi concentration camps.\n","During the last year of the war, Sweden began to play a role in humanitarian efforts, and many refugees, among them several thousand Jews from Nazi-occupied Europe, were rescued thanks to the Swedish rescue missions to internment camps and partly because Sweden served as a haven for refugees, primarily from the Nordic countries and the Baltic states.\n","Nevertheless, both Swedes and others have argued that Sweden could have done more to oppose the Nazis' war efforts, even if it meant increasing the risk of occupation.\n","Sweden was officially a neutral country and remained outside NATO and Warsaw Pact membership during the Cold War, but privately Sweden's leadership had strong ties with the United States and other western governments.\n","Following the war, Sweden took advantage of an intact industrial base, social stability and its natural resources to expand its industry to supply the rebuilding of Europe.\n","Sweden received aid under the Marshall Plan and participated in the OECD.\n","Sweden was one of the founding states of the European Free Trade Area .\n","Sweden, like many industrialised countries, entered a period of economic decline and upheaval following the oil embargoes of 1973–74 and 1978–79.\n","Sweden's GDP declined by around 5%.\n","The response of the government was to cut spending and institute a multitude of reforms to improve Sweden's competitiveness, among them reducing the welfare state and privatising public services and goods.\n","Sweden joined the European Union on 1 January 1995.\n","In 2006 Sweden got its first majority government for decades as the centre-right Alliance defeated the incumbent Social Democrat government.\n","Following the rapid growth of support for the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats, and their entrance to the Riksdag in 2010, the Alliance became a minority cabinet.\n","Until recently Sweden remained non-aligned militarily, although it participated in some joint military exercises with NATO and some other countries, in addition to extensive cooperation with other European countries in the area of defence technology and defence industry.\n","However, in 2022, in response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Sweden moved to formally join the NATO alliance.\n","The same year, Sweden applied for NATO membership and was formally invited to join the alliance at the NATO Summit in Madrid.\n","The secretary general of NATO Jens Stoltenberg spoke of a fast-track membership process of just a few weeks, however NATO member Turkey has repeatedly hindered Sweden from joining the alliance, demanding Swedish action against the PKK and for Sweden to extradite alleged Kurdish \"terrorists\" to Turkey, the situation straining relations between the two countries.\n","Sweden has a long history of participating in international military operations, including Afghanistan, where Swedish troops are under NATO command, and in EU-sponsored peacekeeping operations in Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Cyprus.\n","Sweden also participated in enforcing a UN mandated no-fly zone over Libya during the Arab Spring.\n","Sweden held the chair of the European Union from 1 July to 31 December 2009.\n","In recent decades Sweden has become a more culturally diverse nation due to significant immigration; in 2013, it was estimated that 15% of the population was foreign-born, and an additional 5% of the population were born to two immigrant parents.\n","In response to these violent events, the anti-immigration opposition party, the Sweden Democrats, promoted their anti-immigration policies, while the left-wing opposition blamed growing inequality caused by the centre-right government's socioeconomic policies.\n","The Sweden Democrats held the balance of power and voted the government's budget down in the Riksdag, but due to agreements between the government and the Alliance, the government was able to hang onto power.\n","Sweden was heavily affected by the 2015 European migrant crisis, eventually forcing the government to tighten regulations of entry to the country, as Sweden received thousands of asylum seekers and migrants predominantly from Africa and the Middle East per week in autumn, overwhelming existing structures.\n","The 2018 general election saw the Red-greens lose seats to the right-wing Sweden Democrats and to the centre-right parties of the former Alliance.\n","In August 2021, Prime Minister Stefan Lofven announced his resignation and finance minister Magdalena Andersson was elected as the new head of Sweden's ruling Social Democrats in November 2021.\n","On 30 November 2021, Magdalena Andersson became Sweden's first female prime minister.\n","On 18 October 2022, Ulf Kristersson of the Moderate Party became the new Prime Minister of Sweden.\n","The new government will be backed by the biggest right-wing party, Sweden Democrats  led by Jimmie Åkesson, meaning tougher immigration policies as a crucial part of a policy deal with the SD.\n","Situated in Northern Europe, Sweden lies west of the Baltic Sea and Gulf of Bothnia, providing a long coastline, and forms the eastern part of the Scandinavian Peninsula.\n","To the west is the Scandinavian mountain chain , a range that separates Sweden from Norway.\n","Sweden lies between latitudes 55° and 70° N, and mostly between longitudes 11° and 25° E .\n","At 449,964 km2 , Sweden is the 55th-largest country in the world, the fifth-largest country in Europe, and the largest country in Northern Europe.\n","The lowest elevation in Sweden is in the bay of Lake Hammarsjön, near Kristianstad, at −2.41 m  below sea level.\n","Sweden has 25 provinces or landskap, based on culture, geography and history.\n","Sweden also has the Vindelfjällen Nature Reserve, one of the largest protected areas in Europe, totaling 562,772 ha \n","About 15% of Sweden lies north of the Arctic Circle.\n","Southern Sweden is predominantly agricultural, with increasing forest coverage northward.\n","Around 65% of Sweden's total land area is covered with forests.\n","The highest population density is in the Öresund Region in southern Sweden, along the western coast up to central Bohuslän, and in the valley of lake Mälaren and Stockholm.\n","Gotland and Öland are Sweden's largest islands; Vänern and Vättern are its largest lakes.\n","Combined with the third- and fourth-largest lakes Mälaren and Hjälmaren, these lakes take up a significant part of southern Sweden's area.\n","Sweden's extensive waterway availability throughout the south was exploited with the building of the Göta Canal in the 19th century, shortening the potential distance between the Baltic Sea south of Norrköping and Gothenburg by using the lake and river network to facilitate the canal.\n","Sweden also has plenty of long rivers draining the lakes.\n","Northern and Central Sweden have several wide rivers known as älvar, commonly sourced within the Scandinavian Mountains.\n","In southern Sweden, narrower rivers known as åar are also common.\n","Most of Sweden has a temperate climate, despite its northern latitude, with largely four distinct seasons and mild temperatures throughout the year.\n","Daytime highs in Sweden's municipal seats vary from 19 °C  to 24 °C  in July and −9 °C  to 3 °C  in January.\n","Sweden is much warmer and drier than other places at a similar latitude, and even somewhat farther south, mainly because of the combination of the Gulf Stream and the general west wind drift, caused by the direction of planet Earth's rotation.\n","Sweden has much milder winters than many parts of Russia, Canada, and the northern United States.\n","Because of Sweden's high latitude, the length of daylight varies greatly.\n","Sweden receives between 1,100 and 1,900 hours of sunshine annually.\n","The highest temperature ever recorded in Sweden was 38 °C  in Målilla in 1947, while the coldest temperature ever recorded was −52.6 °C  in Vuoggatjålme on 2 February 1966.\n","Temperatures expected in Sweden are heavily influenced by the large Fennoscandian landmass, as well as continental Europe and western Russia, which allows hot or cool inland air to be easily transported to Sweden.\n","That, in turn, renders most of Sweden's southern areas having warmer summers than almost everywhere in the nearby British Isles, even matching temperatures found along the continental Atlantic coast as far south as in northern Spain.\n","Apart from the ice-free Atlantic bringing marine air into Sweden tempering winters, the mildness is further explained by prevailing low-pressure systems postponing winter, with the long nights often staying above freezing in the south of the country due to the abundant cloud cover.\n","Transitional seasons are normally quite extensive and the four-season climate applies to most of Sweden's territory, except in Scania where some years do not record a meteorological winter  or in the high Lapland mountains where polar microclimates exist.\n","On average, most of Sweden receives between 500 and 800 mm  of precipitation each year, making it considerably drier than the global average.\n","Despite northerly locations, southern and central Sweden may have almost no snow in some winters.\n","Most of Sweden is located in the rain shadow of the Scandinavian Mountains through Norway and north-west Sweden.\n","It is predicted that as the Barents Sea gets less frozen in the coming winters, becoming thus \"Atlantified\", additional evaporation will increase future snowfalls in Sweden and much of continental Europe.\n","Sweden has a considerable south to north distance  which causes large climatic difference, especially during the winter.\n","Sweden is divided in five major vegetation zones.\n","Sweden had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 5.35/10, ranking it 103rd globally out of 172 countries.\n","Sweden has four fundamental laws  which together form the Constitution: the Instrument of Government , the Act of Succession , the Freedom of the Press Act , and the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression  .\n","The public sector in Sweden is divided into two parts: the legal person known as the State  and local authorities: the latter include Regional Councils  landsting152153 and local Municipalities .\n","The local authorities, rather than the State, make up the larger part of the public sector in Sweden.\n","Sweden is a constitutional monarchy, and King Carl XVI Gustaf is the head of state, but the role of the monarch is limited to ceremonial and representative functions.\n","The King opens the annual Riksdag session, chairs the Special Council held during a change of Government, holds regular Information Councils with the Prime Minister and the Government, chairs the meetings of the Advisory Council on Foreign Affairs , and receives Letters of Credence of foreign ambassadors to Sweden and signs those of Swedish ambassadors sent abroad.\n","Apart from strictly official duties, the King and the other members of Royal Family undertake a variety of unofficial and other representative duties within Sweden and abroad.\n","For over 50 years, Sweden had had five parties who continually received enough votes to gain seats in the Riksdag—the Social Democrats, the Moderate Party, the Centre Party, the Liberal People's Party and the Left Party—before the Green Party became the sixth party in the 1988 election.\n","It was not until elections in 2010 that an eighth party, the Sweden Democrats, gained Riksdag seats.\n","In the 2006 general election the Moderate Party formed the centre-right Alliance for Sweden bloc and won a majority of the Riksdag seats.\n","Nevertheless, neither the Alliance, nor the left block, chose to form a coalition with the Sweden Democrats.\n","The outcome of the 2014 general election resulted in the attainment of more seats by the three centre-left parties in comparison to the centre-right Alliance for Sweden, with the two blocs receiving 159 and 141 seats respectively.\n","The non-aligned Sweden Democrats more than doubled their support and won the remaining 49 seats.\n","In August 2021, Prime Minister Stefan Löfven announced his resignation and finance minister Magdalena Andersson was elected as the new head of Sweden's ruling Social Democrats in November 2021.\n","On 30 November 2021, Magdalena Andersson became Sweden's first female prime minister.\n","This was backed up by the surging Sweden Democrats becoming the second largest party.\n","Election turnout in Sweden has always been high by international comparison.\n","Sweden is a unitary state divided into 21 regions  and 290 municipalities .\n","Municipal and region government in Sweden is similar to city commission and cabinet-style council government.\n","These have no official political responsibilities but are traditional subdivisions of the Church of Sweden and still have some importance as census districts for census-taking and elections.\n","The actual age of the kingdom of Sweden is unknown.\n","Establishing the age depends mostly on whether Sweden should be considered a nation when the Svear  ruled Svealand or if the emergence of the nation started with the Svear and the Götar  of Götaland being united under one ruler.\n","These events are often described as the consolidation of Sweden, although substantial areas were conquered and incorporated later.\n","Earlier kings, for which no reliable historical sources exist, can be read about in mythical kings of Sweden and semi-legendary kings of Sweden.\n","The title Sveriges och Götes Konung was last used for Gustaf I of Sweden, after which the title became \"King of Sweden, of the Goths and of the Wends\"  in official documentation.\n","Up until the beginning of the 1920s, all laws in Sweden were introduced with the words, \"We, the king of Sweden, of the Goths and Wends\".\n","The present King of Sweden, Carl XVI Gustaf, was the first monarch officially proclaimed \"King of Sweden\"  with no additional peoples mentioned in his title.\n","In 1866, Sweden became a constitutional monarchy with a bicameral parliament, with the First Chamber indirectly elected by local governments, and the Second Chamber directly elected in national elections every four years.\n","Sweden has a history of strong political involvement by ordinary people through its \"popular movements\" , the most notable being trade unions, the independent Christian movement, the temperance movement, the women's movement, and the intellectual property pirate movements.\n","Sweden was the first country in the world to outlaw corporal punishment of children by their parents 190.\n","Sweden is currently leading the EU in statistics measuring equality in the political system and equality in the education system.\n","The Global Gender Gap Report 2006 ranked Sweden as the number one country in terms of gender equality.\n","The Supreme Court of Sweden  is the third and final instance in all civil and criminal cases in Sweden.\n","According to a victimisation survey of 1,201 residents in 2005, Sweden has above-average crime rates compared to other EU countries.\n","Sweden has high or above-average levels of assaults, sexual assaults, hate crimes, and consumer fraud.\n","Sweden has low levels of burglary, car theft and drug problems.\n","A mid-November 2013 news report announced that four prisons in Sweden were closed during the year due to a significant drop in the number of inmates.\n","The decrease in the number of Swedish prisoners was considered \"out-of-the-ordinary\" by the head of Sweden's prison and probation services, with prison numbers in Sweden falling by around 1% a year since 2004.\n","Sweden's government pursued an independent course of nonalignment in times of peace so that neutrality would be possible in the event of war.\n","Sweden's doctrine of neutrality is often traced back to the 19th century as the country has not been in a state of war since the end of the Swedish campaign against Norway in 1814.\n","During World War II Sweden joined neither the allied nor axis powers.\n","This has sometimes been disputed since in effect Sweden allowed in select cases the Nazi regime to use its railroad system to transport troops and goods, especially iron ore from mines in northern Sweden, which was vital to the German war machine.\n","However, Sweden also indirectly contributed to the defence of Finland in the Winter War, and permitted the training of Norwegian and Danish troops in Sweden after 1943.\n","During the early Cold War era, Sweden combined its policy of non-alignment and a low profile in international affairs with a security policy based on strong national defence.\n","Beginning in the late 1960s, Sweden attempted to play a more significant and independent role in international relations.\n","The incident triggered a diplomatic crisis between Sweden and the Soviet Union.\n","Following the 1986 assassination of Olof Palme and with the end of the Cold War, Sweden has adopted a more traditional foreign policy approach.\n","Since 1995 Sweden has been a member of the European Union, and as a consequence of a new world security situation the country's foreign policy doctrine has been partly modified, with Sweden playing a more active role in European security co-operation.\n","In 2022, in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Sweden moved to formally join the NATO alliance.\n","The secretary general of NATO Jens Stoltenberg spoke of a fast-track membership process of just a few weeks, however NATO member Turkey has repeatedly hindered Sweden from joining the alliance, demanding Swedish action against the PKK and for Sweden to extradite alleged Kurdish \"terrorists\" to Turkey, the situation straining relations between the two countries.\n","The law is enforced in Sweden by several government entities.\n","The Försvarsmakten  are a government agency reporting to the Swedish Ministry of Defence and responsible for the peacetime operation of the armed forces of Sweden.\n","The primary task of the agency is to train and deploy peacekeeping forces abroad, while maintaining the long-term ability to refocus on the defence of Sweden in the event of war.\n","On 1 July 2010, Sweden ended routine conscription, switching to an all-volunteer force unless otherwise required for defence readiness.\n","This in comparison with the 1980s, before the fall of the Soviet Union, when Sweden could gather up to 1,000,000 servicemembers.\n","Sweden decided not to sign the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.\n","Sweden is the twelfth-richest country in the world in terms of GDP  per capita and a high standard of living is experienced by its citizens.\n","Sweden is an export-oriented mixed economy.\n","Sweden's engineering sector accounts for 50% of output and exports, while telecommunications, the automotive industry and the pharmaceutical industries are also of great importance.\n","Sweden is the ninth-largest arms exporter in the world.\n","Trade unions, employers' associations and collective agreements cover a large share of the employees in Sweden.\n","In 2010, Sweden's income Gini coefficient was the third lowest among developed countries, at 0.25—slightly higher than Japan and Denmark—suggesting Sweden had low income inequality.\n","However, Sweden's wealth Gini coefficient at 0.853 was the second highest in developed countries, and above European and North American averages, suggesting high wealth inequality.\n","Even on a disposable income basis, the geographical distribution of Gini coefficient of income inequality varies within different regions and municipalities of Sweden.\n","Danderyd, outside Stockholm, has Sweden's highest Gini coefficient of income inequality, at 0.55, while Hofors near Gävle has the lowest at 0.25.\n","In and around Stockholm and Scania, two of the more densely populated regions of Sweden, the income Gini coefficient is between 0.35 and 0.55.\n","The vast majority of Sweden's industry is privately controlled, unlike many other industrialised Western countries, and, in accordance with a historical

Moreover, we observe a slowly increasing accuracy. We use accuracy as a metric, so that we can get sort of an idea of when to stop. The bad thing about our approach is that we train all models for an equal number of epochs this way when that is not necessarily the best course of action, but let us not focus too much on this now as the training does not take that long anyway and we just want to create word embeddings. We used an equal number of epochs for all models to make it easier to compare the losses and accuracies of the different models at equal numbers of epochs. After 12 epochs for the model that considers 50 dimensions, we observe that the accuracy does not increase significantly anymore (even decreases a bit during one epoch). This can also be observed for the model with 150 dimensions after epoch 6. For the model with 300 dimensions, we can already stop after 4 epochs since the accuracy only keeps decreasing. Hence, we observe that training these models for more epochs does not necessarily lead to a better accuracy.\n","\n","A major reason for this low accuracy is the corpus size being of relatively small size. Our corpus, namely `alice.txt`, has only 26,283 words before processing the file, which is a lot less than the millions of words that are mentioned by Mikolov et al. in [1]. We suspect that this results in our models simply not being able to learn much from our corpus. This is highlighted even more by Mikolov et al. [1] in  tables 2 and 3 in [1]. Since we trained our models on a relatively small corpus, low accuracies were to be expected. Rezaeinia et al.

With the CBOW model, we want to predict words based on their context. We do this by using a window around the word we want to predict. In our code, this window is represented by the `window_size`. All words contained in the window are the context words. Note that if we want to predict the first or final few words of a sentence (depends on the window size), it might be the case that our window reaches the previous or next sentence, respectively.

The major reason for this concerns the size of our corpus. Our corpus, namely `alice.txt`, has only 26,283 words before processing the file, which is a lot less than the millions of words that are mentioned by Mikolov et al. in [1]. This suggests that our models are simply not able to learn much from our corpus since there is not that much to learn from.\n","\n","Note, however, that for the analogy \"*small* is to *smaller* as *large* is to ? (*larger*)\", SG_150 and SG_300 almost predicted the correct word (the true word was in the top 3 and top 2, respectively). This result can be observed in the output of the code cell above this cell and in the table. Especially SG_300 was extremely close to predicting this word correctly. A possible reason for these almost correct predictions could be due to the fact that this type of analogy is relatively easy to solve compared to some of our other analogies. More specifically, \"small\" and \"smaller\" are very similar because \"smaller\" is simply \"small\" + \"er\", and \"large\" and \"larger\" are very similar because \"larger\" is simply \"large\" + \"r\". While the predictions by the models were not completely correct (these words were not the nearest words), we still thought it would be interesting to mention this fact.\n","\n","Given the poor performance of both models on the analogies (on our corpus), it is tough to say which model performs better. To be able to draw sound conclusions on which type of model is more suitable for predicting analogies, we believe that we would require a larger corpus. If we were to draw a conclusion from the results we have right now, we would argue that Skipgram performs slightly better since it almost predicted the correct word twice, as mentioned in the paragraph above. This is supported by a comment from Mikolov in [4], where he, based on his experience, argues that Skipgram works well with a small amount of the training data and represents rare words or phrases well.\n","\n","From the table, we observe that for the lowest dimension (namely `dim=50`), both types of models are more inclined to predict different words than models with larger dimensions (namely `dim=150` and `dim=300`). See, for example, the analogy \"Love is to hate as little is to ?\", where CBOW_150 and CBOW_300 both predicted \"kissed\", while CBOW_50 predicted \"melancholy\". Another example is the analogy \"A man is to a woman as a king is to a ?\", where SG_150 and SG_300 both predicted \"childhood\", while SG_50 predicted \"leave\". This occurrence could stem from the fact that our corpus size is rather small, which results in us suspecting that there are fewer \"features\" to learn from (e.g., fewer diverse words with different meanings in different contexts) than in much larger corpora. Note that this occurrence only happens three times in total. We thought that it would be something interesting enough to mention in this section.\n","\n","We initially ran these methods without excluding the words that were present in the analogy. When we did not exclude these words, we observed that we often predicted one of the three words that were present in the analogy. Intuitively, this makes sense as these words are used in the input and, therefore, heavily influence the result. Based on these experiments and applying some logic, it makes a lot of sense why Mikolov et al.

The shape of the training samples for CBOW is $(27165, 4)$, which can be seen as $27165$ samples, where each sample contains $4$ (context) words. This means that, for CBOW, the size of the training data equals the total number of words in the corpus. \n","\n","The shape of the training samples for Skipgram is $(94556,)$, which can be seen as $94556$ samples, each containing a single word. This means that, for Skipgram, the size of the training data is slightly less than `n_samples` $\\cdot$ `window_size` $\\cdot 2$ in most cases. The actual size is somewhat less because we cannot capture all words in the full window size for words at the beginning and end of sentences. We will cover this more in the next few paragraphs.\n","\n","Based on the information above, we can clearly conclude that Skipgram has more training samples if both CBOW and Skipgram have the same sentences as input.\n","\n","### Why?\n","Let us consider how the data is generated for each method.\n","\n","In CBOW, we have a training sample for each word we want to predict. This means that the total number of training samples is equal to the total number of words in the corpus. Moreover, each training sample consists of all the words that are contained in a window around the word we want to predict. Let $L$ denote the window size. The total number of words per training sample equals $2L$ after applying padding to make sure each training sample has $2L$ words.\n","\n","In Skipgram, we want to predict the context words based on an input word. In practice, we generated the training samples by specifying a window size $L$ and iterating over all sentences. For each word $w_t$ in the sentence, we add the word pairs $(w_t, w_{t-L}), \\cdots, (w_t, w_{t-1}), (w_t, w_{t+1}), \\cdots (w_t, w_{t+L})$ to the set of training samples. Note that it might not always be possible to make use of the full window size because it might be the case that, for example, at the beginning of a sentence, we cannot consider the $L$ words before the first word of that sentence since these words do not exist in our sentence. (This 'issue' has to do with us considering all words within a certain sentence.) This problem also appears when we consider words at the end of the sentence. This is a reason as to why we have slightly less than the number we proposed above.\n","\n","From these descriptions of the data generation methods for both models, it is evident why Skipgram has more training samples than CBOW for an equal number of sentences with the same content. In conclusion, Skipgram has slightly less than `n_samples` $\\cdot$ `window_size` $\\cdot 2$ samples due to the way the samples are created. On the other hand, CBOW has `n_samples` training samples. Again, the former is larger in size (assuming `window_size` $\\geq 1$)."]}]}
